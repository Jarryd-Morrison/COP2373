Program Description:
The program simulates a simplified Poker game that deals a hand of five cards from a standard deck.
It allows the user to select cards to replace during a "draw" phase and then displays the final hand.
The user inputs which cards they wish to discard by typing out the number of the card, if there is more
than one card to be discarded they use a comma to separate it.

1. Card Class
Purpose: Represents a single playing card with a suit and rank.

Attributes:
 suit (int): Encodes the suit of the card (0: Clubs, 1: Diamonds, 2: Hearts, 3: Spades).
 rank (int): Encodes the rank of the card (1: Ace, 2-10: Number cards, 11: Jack, 12: Queen, 13: King).

Methods:
 
__init__(self, suit=0, rank=2):

 Parameters:
  suit: The suit of the card (default: 0).
  rank: The rank of the card (default: 2).

Logical Steps:
 Assigns the suit and rank to the instance attributes.

Returns: None.

 __str__(self):

Purpose: Provides a string representation of the card (e.g., "Ace of Spades").

Logical Steps:
Accesses the ranks and suits lists to convert numerical attributes into human-readable strings.

Returns: A formatted string representing the card.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. Deck Class

Purpose: Manages a collection of 52 cards and provides functionality for shuffling and dealing.

Attributes:
 cards (list): A list containing Card objects representing all 52 cards in the deck.

Methods:

 __init__(self):

Purpose: Initializes the deck with all 52 unique cards.

 Logical Steps:
  Iterates through all combinations of suits (0-3) and ranks (1-13).
  Creates a Card object for each combination and stores it in the cards list.

 Returns: None.

 shuffle(self):

 Purpose: Randomizes the order of the cards in the deck.

 Logical Steps:
  Uses Pythonâ€™s random.shuffle function to shuffle the cards list in place.

 Returns: None.

 deal(self, num):

 Purpose: Removes and returns the top num cards from the deck.

 Parameters:
  num (int): The number of cards to deal.

 Variables:
  dealt_cards (list): Holds the cards being dealt.

 Logical Steps:
  Checks if num is greater than the remaining number of cards in the deck.
  If valid, slices the first num cards from cards and updates the deck.

 Returns: A list of Card objects representing the dealt cards.

3. poker_hand_game() Function

Purpose: Simulates a Poker hand game with an initial deal, user input to replace cards, and final hand display.

Logical Steps:

 Deck Initialization:
  Creates an instance of the Deck class and shuffles it.

 Initial Deal:
  Deals 5 cards to the player using the deal method of the Deck class.
  Displays the initial hand with card indices (1-5) for user reference.

 User Input for Replacement:
  Prompts the user to enter indices (comma-separated) of cards they wish to replace.
  Validates input:
   Checks if indices are integers within the range (1-5).
   Handles invalid input by printing an error message and ending the game.

 Replace Selected Cards:
  For each valid index provided by the user:
  Replaces the corresponding card in the hand with a new card from the deck.

 Final Hand Display:
  Prints the updated hand after the draw phase.

Returns: None.
