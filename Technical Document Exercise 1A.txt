Description:
This program is designed to sell 20 total tickets and to keep track of how many buyers there were. In addition to this no buyer is able to purchase
more than 4 tickets or less than 0, the program would continue to run until there are 0 tickets remaining to be purchased. After all tickets have been sold,
the program displays the number of buyers.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Logical Steps:
1. The program sets a value of 20 to the variable TICKETS and a value of 0 to the variable BUYERS_COUNTS.
2.Program prints out the total number of TICKETS.
3.Program sets a loop as long as TICKETS > 0 prompting the user to enter the amount of TICKETS they would like to buy, entered value is logged as a variable TO_BUY.
3.Program sets a conditional to check if the entered value for TO_BUY is < 0,  if it is > 4 or if it is greater than the number of available TICKETS.
If true, it prints that the user is unable to purchase that many tickets and displays the total number of TICKETS available.
4.Program checks if the number of TICKETS = 0, if true the program breaks out of the loop and displays the BUYER_COUNT.
5. Program checks if either if statements are true, if not then the program preforms the calculation to the variables TICKETS and BUYERS_COUNT, then displays
the number of tickets available.

    Variables:
1.TICKETS, stores the number of tickets available for purchase.
2.BUYERS_COUNT, stores the number of buyers as the commands are run.
3.TO_BUY, stores the amount of tickets the user asks to purchase for calculations.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Functions:
1.Sets up a loop to repeatedly ask how many tickets the user wants as long as the number of tickets is greater than 0.
2.Conditional statement that checks if the number of tickets being purchases is less than 0 or greater than 4, if true it prints "Sorry, you can't buy that many.".
3.Conditional statement to check if the number of tickes = 0, if true it breaks the loop, if false it calcualtes the number of tickets sold and number of buyers and repeats loop.
